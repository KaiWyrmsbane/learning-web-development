----------------------------------JavaScript / ES6--------------------------------------
-----Data types-----
-strings EX: "hello"
-numbers EX: 12345
-boolean EX: true or false
+If you ever question the data type of something then you can use typeof which returns the data type
 of the content that is given to the keyword.

-----Adding behaviour to websites-----
+https://github.com/rwaldron/idiomatic.js
+we can use snippets in the chrome browser to test code
+ alert(); Gives an alert to the user
+ prompt(); Enables the user to enter something into the prompt when you run the code
+These are known as functions which give functionality
+ alert:function ("hello"):message ;:end

-----JavaScript Variables-----
+var is the way for the computer to store information when something is assigned to var

-----Naming Conventions-----
+be sure to give vairables meaningful names
+var can't start with a number(1234)
+letters, numbers, $, _ are the only things allowed when naming variables
+use camelCasing  EX: helloThere, bogBag, userName, userInput

-----String concatenation-----
+can combine string "a"+"b"="ab" 
+can also combine variables and string by doing the following ("nice to meet you, " + userName);

-----Slicing and Case changing for strings-----
+var name = "Angela"
-name.slice(starting_position, ending_position)
+slicing can be used to split-up strings .slice(number(SP), number(EP)) SP:starting_position EP:ending_position
+word.toUpperCase(); capitalizes word
+word.toLowerCase(); lower cases a word
EX: var name = "john"; name.toUpperCase(); = "JOHN" name.toLowerCase(); = "john"

-----Basic Arithmetic and the Modulo Operator-----
+Addition var a = 2+3; a = 5
+Subtraction var b = 10-2; b = 8
+Multiplication var c = 2*3; c = 6
+Division var d = 6/2; d = 3
+Modulo var e = 9%6; e = 3 modulo is division but returns the remainder not the actual outcome of the division
+modulo symbol ( % )
